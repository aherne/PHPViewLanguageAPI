<h2 id="tags">How do they work?</h2>
<p>A tag is a ViewLanguage representation of a <i>scripting logic</i>. All tags act like an extension of HTML standard and as such they have names and optionally attributes and bodies. There are two types of tags known by ViewLanguage:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#macros"><i>macro tags</i></a>: api-defined tags to be processed before content is compiled.<br/>
        Example: <code class="html">&lt;import file="header"/&gt;</code>which in PHP translates to:<br/><code class="php">file_get_contents('header.php')</code>
        <br/>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#libraries"><i>library tags</i></a>: api/user-defined tags subject to compilation that belong to a library and have an unique name within that library.<br/>
        Example: <code class="html">&lt;:foreach var="${foo}" val="bar"&gt; ${bar} &lt;/:foreach&gt;</code>which in PHP translates to:<br/><code class="php">foreach($foo as $bar) { echo $bar; }</code>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A very powerful feature is the <strong>ability of tags to be recursive</strong>: it is allowed to put View Language tags inside View Language tags. Whenever that happens, compiler goes progressively deeper until no tags are left.</p>
